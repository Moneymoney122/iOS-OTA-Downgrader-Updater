## What is this?

- This script is for updating the [iOS-OTA-Downgrader](https://github.com/LukeZGD/iOS-OTA-Downgrader) script made by LukeZGD whilst keeping your custom iPSW files and SHSH blobs without having to manually copy them over

- This script is not made by LukeZGD, it is made by me (Moneymoney122)

- It is intended for use on linux (only tested on Arch Linux, but should work on every distro)

- It may or may not work

- Use it at your own risk, I am not responsible for any damage it may cause.

- I have no idea why I made this script, and I have no idea if it is actually useful or not

- Released on the 21st of September 2022

- License: GPL-3.0 license

## Credits:

- Me (Moneymoney122) for making this script

- LukeZGD for making the [iOS-OTA-Downgrader](https://github.com/LukeZGD/iOS-OTA-Downgrader) script

## How to use this script:

 run `git clone https://github.com/Moneymoney122/iOS-OTA-Downgrader-Updater` in the terminal while in your home directory or download the zip from this page and unzip the files and place them in a folder called "iOS-OTA-Downgrader-Updater" (without the quotes) in your home directory

`cd ~/iOS-OTA-Downgrader-Updater/`

`chmod +x iOS-OTA-Downgrader-Updater.sh`

This script will ask for your user's password, this is not intended to be anything malicious and you can check the code yourself if you want

## Dependencies for this script:

## Issues/Contact Me:

- If you have any issues with this script or any of my other projects, please open a github issue or contact me on twitter (@chandler_hacker)

## Possible future updates:

- Currently looking to see whether it's possible to add the ability to check for updates on the iOS-OTA-Downgrader script, check to see if the dependencies are installed and what Linux distro this is running on

## Images, No useful reason why I want to add them:

- iOS 6
